  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <button class="accordion">Price of Artworks</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Elizabeth Xi Bauer represents artists in the primary market, meaning clients are the first owners after the artist. Prices are set in collaboration with peers, professors, and galleries, based on the artist's track record, medium, size, and uniqueness. Prices are reviewed periodically based on activity such as exhibitions and publications.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Location of Artworks</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Artworks are stored at Crown Fine Art, with Elizabeth Xi Bauer, or with the artists themselves.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Ownership of Artworks</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Once purchased, ownership transfers directly from the artist to the client, in line with Elizabeth Xi Bauer's terms and conditions.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Delivery / Storage</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Clients are encouraged to take delivery of artworks. They may self-collect, arrange their own delivery, or use Liz Xi's recommended specialist art transporters. Storage is available for free for 2 years, then Â£100/year per artwork thereafter.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Framing</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Framing advice is available. Works on canvas don't require frames unless for aesthetic or protective purposes. Clients may use recommended expert framers or their own provider.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Insurance</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Artworks are often covered by standard home contents insurance. Clients should check with their insurer. For high-value artworks, specialist art insurance is recommended, and Liz Xi can advise on providers.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Exit Strategies</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Clients can sell their artworks on the secondary market via auction, platforms, or galleries. No guaranteed resale value. Art investment is considered medium- to long-term, with an estimated 5-year hold for significant gains. Occasionally, Liz Xi may offer resale opportunities.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Exhibiting Works</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>From time to time, Liz Xi may request to include client-owned artworks in exhibitions. Client permission is always sought, and insurance/transportation is covered.</p>
  </div>
